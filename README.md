# Battery Lifetime Optimisation of Wireless Sensor Networks

# File details

LEACHGUI runs the original LEACH protocol.

ILEACH is the improved LEACH algorithm found in the available literature.

ILEACH2AG is a new technique that uses AI based heuristic searches to optimize network lifetime.

Each file upon execution writes the data points(number of dead nodes and network energy) after each round into text files.
