# Battery Lifetime Optimisation of Wireless Sensor Networks

This project uses A* search algorithm to optimize the average battery lifetime of a network of wireless sensor nodes

# Instructions

LEACHGUI runs the original LEACH protocol.

ILEACH is the improved LEACH algorithm found in the available literature.

OHILEACH(Optimized heuristic ILEACH) is a new technique that uses AI based heuristic searches to optimize network lifetime.

Each file upon execution writes the data points (number of dead nodes and network energy) after each round into text files.

Run Juxtapoe.m file after running the above 3. All should be in the same directory as Jutapose.m will read data written by the above 3 programs into text files and produce graphical comparisons.
